      <subsection title="Background">
         <data>Resistance by native Caribs prevented colonization on Saint Vincent until 1719. Disputed
                          between France and the UK for most of the 18th century, the island was ceded to the latter in
                          1783. The British prized Saint Vincent due to its fertile soil, which allowed for thriving
                          slave-run plantations of sugar, coffee, indigo, tobacco, cotton, and cocoa. In 1834, the
                          British abolished slavery. Immigration of indentured servants eased the ensuing labor
                          shortage, as did subsequent Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and East Indian laborers.
                          Conditions remained harsh for both former slaves and immigrant agricultural workers, however,
                          as depressed world sugar prices kept the economy stagnant until the early 1900s. The economy
                          then went into a period of decline with many landowners abandoning their estates and leaving
                          the land to be cultivated by liberated slaves. Between 1960 and 1962, Saint Vincent and the
                          Grenadines was a separate administrative unit of the Federation of the West Indies. Autonomy
                          was granted in 1969 and independence in 1979.</data>
