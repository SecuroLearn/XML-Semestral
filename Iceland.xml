         <content>Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants
                                                    during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the
                                                    world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althingi,
                                                    established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was
                                                    subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja
                                                    volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused
                                                    widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the
                                                    island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Denmark
                                                    granted limited home rule in 1874 and complete independence in 1944.
                                                    The second half of the 20th century saw substantial economic growth
                                                    driven primarily by the fishing industry. The economy diversified
                                                    greatly after the country joined the European Economic Area in 1994,
                                                    but Iceland was especially hard hit by the global financial crisis
                                                    in the years following 2008. The economy is now on an upward
                                                    trajectory, fueled primarily by a tourism and construction boom.
