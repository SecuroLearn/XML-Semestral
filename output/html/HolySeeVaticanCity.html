      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <div>
         <p>Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula for more than
            a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when many of the Papal States were seized
            by the newly united Kingdom of Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were further circumscribed
            when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of "prisoner" popes and Italy
            were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties, which established the independent
            state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984,
            a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty
            provisions, including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion.
            Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom, threats against minority
            Christian communities in Africa and the Middle East, the plight of refugees and migrants,
            sexual misconduct by clergy, international development, interreligious dialogue and
            reconciliation, and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and
            globalization. About 1.3 billion people worldwide profess Catholicism - the world's
            largest Christian faith.</p>

            word "sedes" meaning "seat," and refers to the episcopal chair; the term "Vatican"
            derives from the hill Mons Vaticanus on which the Vatican is located and which comes
            from the Latin "vaticinari" (to prophesy), referring to the fortune tellers and soothsayers

            acknowledged, among other things, the full sovereignty of the Holy See and established
            its territorial extent; however, the origin of the Papal States, which over centuries

      <div>
         <h4>History</h4>
         <p>previous 1929, 1963; latest adopted 26 November 2000, effective 22 February 2001 (Fundamental
            Law of Vatican City State); note - in October 2013, Pope Francis instituted a 9-member
            Council of Cardinal Advisors to reform the administrative apparatus of the Holy See
            (Roman Curia) to include writing a new constitution; on 13 June 2018, Pope Francis
            approved the Council of Cardinals' first draft of the new constitution, Predicatae
            Evangelium, which will replace "Pastor Bonus, the current governing document of the
            Roman Curia</p>
         <h4>Amendments</h4>
         <p>note - although the Fundamental Law of Vatican City State makes no mention of amendments,
            Article Four (drafting laws), states that this legislative responsibility resides
            with the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State; draft legislation is submitted
            through the Secretariat of State and considered by the pope</p>

            See; in the second instance, citizenship may be requested in a limited set of circumstances
            for those who reside within Vatican City under papal authorization, as a function
            of their office or service, or as the spouses and children of current citizens; citizenship
            is lost once an individual no longer permanently resides in Vatican City, normally
            reverting to the citizenship previously held</p>

      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <h3>Economic overview</h3>
      <div>
         <p>The Holy See is supported financially by a variety of sources, including investments,
            real estate income, and donations from Catholic individuals, dioceses, and institutions;
            these help fund the Roman Curia (Vatican bureaucracy), diplomatic missions, and media
            outlets. Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and from direct donations
            go to a non-budgetary fund, known as Peter's Pence, which is used directly by the
            pope for charity, disaster relief, and aid to churches in developing nations.</p>
         <p>The separate Vatican City State budget includes the Vatican museums and post office
            and is supported financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals, and tourist mementos
            as well as fees for admission to museums and publication sales. Revenues increased
            between 2010 and 2011 because of expanded operating hours and a growing number of
            visitors. However, the Holy See did not escape the financial difficulties experienced
            by other European countries; in 2012, it started a spending review to determine where
            to cut costs to reverse its 2011 budget deficit of $20 million. The Holy See generated
            a modest surplus in 2012 before recording a $32 million deficit in 2013, driven primarily
            by the decreasing value of gold. The incomes and living standards of lay workers are
            comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome so most public expenditures
            go to wages and other personnel costs;. In February 2014, Pope FRANCIS created the
            Secretariat of the Economy to oversee financial and administrative operations of the
            Holy See, part of a broader campaign to reform the Holy See’s finances.</p>
