      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <div>
         <p>Carib Indians occupied the islands of the West Indies for hundreds of years before
            the British and French began settlement in 1623. During the course of 17th century,
            Saint Kitts became the premier base for English and French expansion into the Caribbean.
            The French ceded the territory to the UK in 1713. At the turn of the 18th century,
            Saint Kitts was the richest British Crown Colony per capita in the Caribbean, a result
            of the sugar trade. Although small in size and separated by only 3 km (2 mi) of water,
            Saint Kitts and Nevis were viewed and governed as different states until the late-19th
            century, when the British forcibly unified them along with the island of Anguilla.
            In 1967, the island territory of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla became an associated
            state of the UK with full internal autonomy. The island of Anguilla rebelled and was
            allowed to secede in 1971. The remaining islands achieved independence in 1983 as
            Saint Kitts and Nevis. In 1998, a referendum on Nevis to separate from Saint Kitts
            fell short of the two-thirds majority vote needed.</p>

            Saint Kitts lies the Great Salt Pond; Nevis Peak sits in the center of its almost
            circular namesake island and its ball shape complements that of its sister island</p>

         <p>Saint Kitts was, and still is, referred to as Saint Christopher and this name was
            well established by the 17th century (although who first applied the name is unclear);
            in the 17th century a common nickname for Christopher was Kit or Kitt, so the island
            began to be referred to as "Saint Kitt's Island" or just "Saint Kitts"; Nevis is derived
            from the original Spanish name "Nuestra Senora de las Nieves" (Our Lady of the Snows)
            and refers to the white halo of clouds that generally wreathes Nevis Peak</p>

      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <h3>Economic overview</h3>
      <div>
         <p>The economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis depends on tourism; since the 1970s, tourism
            has replaced sugar as the economy’s traditional mainstay. Roughly 200,000 tourists
            visited the islands in 2009, but reduced tourism arrivals and foreign investment led
            to an economic contraction in the 2009-2013 period, and the economy returned to growth
            only in 2014. Like other tourist destinations in the Caribbean, Saint Kitts and Nevis
            is vulnerable to damage from natural disasters and shifts in tourism demand.</p>
         <p>Following the 2005 harvest, the government closed the sugar industry after several
            decades of losses. To compensate for lost jobs, the government has embarked on a program
            to diversify the agricultural sector and to stimulate other sectors of the economy,
            such as export-oriented manufacturing and offshore banking. The government has made
            notable progress in reducing its public debt, from 154% of GDP in 2011 to 83% in 2013,
            although it still faces one of the highest levels in the world, largely attributable
            to public enterprise losses. Saint Kitts and Nevis is among other countries in the
            Caribbean that supplement their economic activity through economic citizenship programs,
            whereby foreigners can obtain citizenship from Saint Kitts and Nevis by investing
            there.</p>

         <p>good interisland and international connections; broadband access; expanded FttP (Fiber
            to the Home) and LTE markets; regulatory development; telecom sector contributes greatly
            to the overall GDP; telecom sector is a growth area (2020)</p>
         <h4>Domestic</h4>
         <p>interisland links via ECFS; fixed-line teledensity about 33 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular

         <h4>Note</h4>
         <p>the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply
            chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced downturn,
            particularly in mobile device production; many network operators delayed upgrades
            to infrastructure; progress towards 5G implementation was postponed or slowed in some
            countries; consumer spending on telecom services and devices was affected by large-scale
            job losses and the consequent restriction on disposable incomes; the crucial nature
            of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home became evident, and received
            some support from governments</p>
