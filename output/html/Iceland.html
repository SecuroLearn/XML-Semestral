      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <div>
         <p>Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants during the late 9th
            and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the world's oldest functioning legislative
            assembly, the Althingi, established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland
            was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875
            devastated the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine. Over the next quarter
            century, 20% of the island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Denmark
            granted limited home rule in 1874 and complete independence in 1944. The second half
            of the 20th century saw substantial economic growth driven primarily by the fishing
            industry. The economy diversified greatly after the country joined the European Economic
            Area in 1994, but Iceland was especially hard hit by the global financial crisis in
            the years following 2008. The economy is now on an upward trajectory, fueled primarily
            by a tourism and construction boom. Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are first
            rate by world standards.</p>

      <div>
         <p>earthquakes and volcanic activity</p>
         <p>volcanism: Iceland, situated on top of a hotspot, experiences severe volcanic activity;
            Eyjafjallajokull (1,666 m) erupted in 2010, sending ash high into the atmosphere and
            seriously disrupting European air traffic; scientists continue to monitor nearby Katla
            (1,512 m), which has a high probability of eruption in the very near future, potentially
            disrupting air traffic; Grimsvoetn and Hekla are Iceland's most active volcanoes;
            other historically active volcanoes include Askja, Bardarbunga, Brennisteinsfjoll,
            Esjufjoll, Hengill, Krafla, Krisuvik, Kverkfjoll, Oraefajokull, Reykjanes, Torfajokull,

      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <h3>Economic overview</h3>
      <div>
         <p>Iceland's economy combines a capitalist structure and free-market principles with
            an extensive welfare system. Except for a brief period during the 2008 crisis, Iceland
            has in recent years achieved high growth, low unemployment, and a remarkably even
            distribution of income. Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing
            and service industries in the last decade, particularly withi`n the fields of tourism,
            software production, and biotechnology. Abundant geothermal and hydropower sources
            have attracted substantial foreign investment in the aluminum sector, boosted economic
            growth, and sparked some interest from high-tech firms looking to establish data centers
            using cheap green energy.</p>
         <p>Tourism, aluminum smelting, and fishing are the pillars of the economy. For decades
            the Icelandic economy depended heavily on fisheries, but tourism has now surpassed
            fishing and aluminum as Iceland’s main export industry. Tourism accounted for 8.6%
            of Iceland’s GDP in 2016, and 39% of total exports of merchandise and services. From
            2010 to 2017, the number of tourists visiting Iceland increased by nearly 400%. Since
            2010, tourism has become a main driver of Icelandic economic growth, with the number
            of tourists reaching 4.5 times the Icelandic population in 2016. Iceland remains sensitive
            to fluctuations in world prices for its main exports, and to fluctuations in the exchange
            rate of the Icelandic Krona.</p>
         <p>Following the privatization of the banking sector in the early 2000s, domestic banks
            expanded aggressively in foreign markets, and consumers and businesses borrowed heavily
            in foreign currencies. Worsening global financial conditions throughout 2008 resulted
            in a sharp depreciation of the krona vis-a-vis other major currencies. The foreign
            exposure of Icelandic banks, whose loans and other assets totaled nearly nine times
            the country's GDP, became unsustainable. Iceland's three largest banks collapsed in
            late 2008. GDP fell 6.8% in 2009, and unemployment peaked at 9.4% in February 2009.
            Three new banks were established to take over the domestic assets of the collapsed
            banks. Two of them have majority ownership by the state, which intends to re-privatize
            them.</p>
         <p>Since the collapse of Iceland's financial sector, government economic priorities have
            included stabilizing the krona, implementing capital controls, reducing Iceland's
            high budget deficit, containing inflation, addressing high household debt, restructuring
            the financial sector, and diversifying the economy. Capital controls were lifted in
            March 2017, but some financial protections, such as reserve requirements for specified
            investments connected to new inflows of foreign currency, remain in place.</p>

      <h3>Telecommunication systems</h3>
      <div>
         <h4>General assessment</h4>
         <p>small but most progressive telecom market in Europe; telecom infrastructure is modern
            and fully digitized, with satellite-earth stations, fiber-optic cables, and an extensive
            broadband network; near universal fixed broadband service of at least 100Mb/s by the
            end of 2021; operator aims for national 5G coverage by end of 2022; good competition
            among mobile and broadband markets; investment by operators and government in support
            of NGN, particularly in rural areas; submarine cable to Ireland; importer of broadcasting
            equipment from Vietnam and China (2020)</p>
         <h4>Domestic</h4>
         <p>liberalization of the telecommunications sector beginning in the late 1990s has led
            to increased competition especially in the mobile services segment of the market;
            37 per 100 for fixed line and 122 per 100 for mobile-cellular subscriptions (2019)</p>
         <h4>International</h4>
         <p>country code - 354; landing points for the CANTAT-3, FARICE-1, Greenland Connect and
            DANICEsubmarine cable system that provides connectivity to Canada, the Faroe Islands,
            Greenland, UK, Denmark, and Germany;satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic
            Ocean), 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions); note - Iceland shares the
            Inmarsat earth station with the other Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway,
            and Sweden) (2019)</p>
         <h4>Note</h4>
         <p>the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply
            chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced downturn,
            particularly in mobile device production; many network operators delayed upgrades
            to infrastructure; progress towards 5G implementation was postponed or slowed in some
            countries; consumer spending on telecom services and devices was affected by large-scale
            job losses and the consequent restriction on disposable incomes; the crucial nature
            of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home became evident, and received
            some support from governments</p>

      <h3>Broadcast media</h3>
      <div>
         <p>state-owned public TV broadcaster (RUV) operates 21 TV channels nationally (RUV and
            RUV 2, though RUV 2 is used less frequently); RUV broadcasts nationally, every household
            in Iceland is required to have RUV as it doubles as the emergency broadcast network;
            RUV also operates stringer offices in the north (Akureyri) and the east (Egilsstadir)
            but operations are all run out of RUV headquarters in Reykjavik; there are 3 privately
            owned TV stations; Stod 2 (Channel 2) is owned by Syn, following 365 Media and Vodafone
            merger, and is headquartered in Reykjavik; Syn also operates 4 sports channels under
            Stod 2; N4 is the only television station headquartered outside of Reykjavik, in Akureyri,
            with local programming for the north, south, and east of Iceland; Hringbraut is the
            newest station and is headquartered in Reykjavik; all of these television stations
            have nationwide penetration as 100% of households have multi-channel services though
            digital and/or fiber-optic connections</p>
         <p>RUV operates 3 radio stations (RAS 1, RAS2, and Rondo) as well as 4 regional stations
            (but they mostly act as range extenders for RUV radio broadcasts nationwide); there
            is 1 privately owned radio conglomerate, Syn (4 stations), that broadcasts nationwide,
            and 3 other radio stations that broadcast to the most densely populated regions of
            the country. In addition there are upwards of 20 radio stations that operate regionally</p>
