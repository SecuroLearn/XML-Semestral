      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <div>
         <p>Greenland, the world's largest island, is about 80% ice-capped. Vikings reached the
            island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish colonization began in the 18th century,
            and Greenland became an integral part of the Danish Realm in 1953. It joined the European
            Community (now the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985 over a dispute centered
            on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland remains a member of the Overseas Countries
            and Territories Association of the EU. Greenland was granted self-government in 1979
            by the Danish parliament; the law went into effect the following year. Greenland voted
            in favor of increased self-rule in November 2008 and acquired greater responsibility
            for internal affairs when the Act on Greenland Self-Government was signed into law
            in June 2009. Denmark, however, continues to exercise control over several policy
            areas on behalf of Greenland, including foreign affairs, security, and financial policy
            in consultation with Greenland's Self-Rule Government.</p>

         <p>dominates North Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe; sparse population
            confined to small settlements along coast; close to one-quarter of the population
            lives in the capital, Nuuk; world's second largest ice sheet after that of Antarctica
            covering an area of 1.71 million sq km (660,000 sq mi) or about 79% of the island,
            and containing 2.85 million cu km (684 thousand cu mi) of ice (this is almost 7% of
            all of the world's fresh water); if all this ice were converted to liquid water, one
            estimate is that it would be sufficient to raise the height of the world's oceans
            by 7.2 m (24 ft)</p>

      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <h3>Economic overview</h3>
      <div>
         <p>Greenland’s economy depends on exports of shrimp and fish, and on a substantial subsidy
            from the Danish Government. Fish account for over 90% of its exports, subjecting the
            economy to price fluctuations. The subsidy from the Danish Government is budgeted
            to be about $535 million in 2017, more than 50% of government revenues, and 25% of
            GDP.</p>
         <p>The economy is expanding after a period of decline. The economy contracted between
            2012 and 2014, grew by 1.7% in 2015 and by 7.7%in 2016. The expansion has been driven
            by larger quotas for shrimp, the predominant Greenlandic export, and also by increased
            activity in the construction sector, especially in Nuuk, the capital. Private consumption
            and tourism also are contributing to GDP growth more than in previous years. Tourism
            in Greenland grew annually around 20% in 2015 and 2016, largely a result of increasing
            numbers of cruise lines now operating in Greenland's western and southern waters during
            the peak summer tourism season.</p>
         <p>The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays
            a dominant role in Greenland's economy. During the last decade the Greenland Self
            Rule Government pursued conservative fiscal and monetary policies, but public pressure
            has increased for better schools, health care, and retirement systems. The budget
            was in deficit in 2014 and 2016, but public debt remains low at about 5% of GDP. The
            government plans a balanced budget for the 2017–20 period.</p>
         <p>Significant challenges face the island, including low levels of qualified labor, geographic
            dispersion, lack of industry diversification, the long-term sustainability of the
            public budget, and a declining population due to emigration. Hydrocarbon exploration
            has ceased with declining oil prices. The island has potential for natural resource
            exploitation with rare-earth, uranium, and iron ore mineral projects proposed, but
            a lack of infrastructure hinders development.</p>

      <h3>Telecommunication systems</h3>
      <div>
         <h4>General assessment</h4>
         <p>adequate domestic and international service provided by satellite, cables, and microwave
            radio relay; the fundamental telecommunications infrastructure consists of a digital
            radio link from Nanortalik in south Greenland to Uummannaq in north Greenland; satellites
            cover north and east Greenland for domestic and foreign telecommunications; a marine
            cable connects south and west Greenland to the rest of the world, extending from Nuuk
            and Qaqortoq to Canada and Iceland (2018)</p>
         <h4>Domestic</h4>
         <p>13 per 100 for fixed-line subscriptions and 115 per 100 for mobile-cellular (2019)</p>

            (2019)</p>
         <h4>Note</h4>
         <p>the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply
            chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced downturn,
            particularly in mobile device production; many network operators delayed upgrades
            to infrastructure; progress towards 5G implementation was postponed or slowed in some
            countries; consumer spending on telecom services and devices was affected by large-scale
            job losses and the consequent restriction on disposable incomes; the crucial nature
            of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home became evident, and received
            some support from governments</p>
