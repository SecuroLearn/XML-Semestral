      <subsection title="Background">
         <data>Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand
                          years until the mid-19th century, when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly
                          united Kingdom of Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome
                          itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of "prisoner" popes and Italy were resolved in
                          1929 by three Lateran Treaties, which established the independent state of Vatican City and
                          granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984, a concordat between the Holy See
                          and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions, including the primacy of Roman
                          Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include religious
                          freedom, threats against minority Christian communities in Africa and the Middle East, the
                          plight of refugees and migrants, sexual misconduct by clergy, international development,
                          interreligious dialogue and reconciliation, and the application of church doctrine in an era
                          of rapid change and globalization. About 1.3 billion people worldwide profess Catholicism -
                          the world's largest Christian faith.</data>
